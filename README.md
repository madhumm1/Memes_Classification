# Memes_Classification

Emotions are fundamental in human communication, and memes have gained popularity as a
medium for expressing various emotions in the digital era. This paper presents a novel approach
for predicting emotions in memes by combining visual and textual information. This project
consists of two phases, focusing on classifying memes into positive, negative, and neutral
categories in the first phase, and further exploring humor, sarcasm, offensiveness, and motivation
levels in the second phase. Our proposed approach utilizes a combination of image and text
analysis techniques. The image analysis involves leveraging state-of-the-art pre-trained models,
while the textual analysis incorporates advanced natural language processing methods. Through
these techniques, relevant features are extracted from the visual content and accompanying
textual captions of memes. By integrating multiple modalities, a comprehensive understanding of
the emotions conveyed in memes is achieved, surpassing the limitations of analyzing individual
modalities. Our developed model demonstrates promising results in accurately classifying
emotions in memes. Its performance is evaluated on a labeled dataset, showcasing its
effectiveness in capturing the emotional impact of memes. In conclusion, this paper presents an
approach for emotion classification in memes, combining visual and textual analysis. The results
highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its potential applications in various
online domains.
